## Context

Improve Plato's terminal user interface experience through enhanced visual design, better input handling, and improved accessibility features. Focus on making the TUI more intuitive, responsive, and user-friendly while maintaining performance. The goal was to create a modern, accessible terminal application that rivals desktop applications in terms of usability while preserving the speed and efficiency of a command-line interface.

This implementation represents a complete transformation of Plato's user interface, elevating it from a basic terminal application to a sophisticated, accessible, and highly responsive development environment. The Enhanced TUI Experience provides users with professional-grade visual feedback, efficient multi-panel workflows, comprehensive accessibility support, and performance optimization that maintains sub-100ms responsiveness even during intensive operations.

The comprehensive test coverage (64 test files) ensures reliability and maintainability, while the modular architecture enables future enhancements and customization. Users benefit from significantly improved productivity through better visual organization, faster navigation, and reduced cognitive load from enhanced status indicators and visual feedback systems.
