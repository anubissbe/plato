# 2025-09-06 Recap: Advanced Context Management - Task 1

This recaps what was built for the spec documented at .agent-os/specs/2025-09-05-advanced-context-management/spec.md.

## Recap

Successfully implemented the semantic indexing foundation for Plato's advanced context management system. This provides the core infrastructure for lightweight codebase analysis with multi-language symbol extraction, import graph construction, and cross-reference tracking. The implementation includes:

- **FileAnalyzer class** - Analyzes source files to extract semantic information
- **SymbolExtractor** - Extracts symbols from TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, and Go code
- **SemanticIndex** - Manages file relationships, symbol references, and import graphs
- **SemanticIndexer** - Enhanced indexer with configurable depth, scope, and ignore patterns
- **Comprehensive test suite** - 24 passing tests covering all components
- **Index persistence** - Serialization and storage mechanism for session continuity

## Context

Implement semantic indexing and intelligent file selection for Plato CLI/TUI to automatically suggest relevant files, provide smart content sampling, and enhance context visualization with 3x faster file discovery and 60% reduced context setup time.
