# 2025-09-05 Recap: Advanced Context Management

This recaps what was built for the spec documented at .agent-os/specs/2025-09-05-advanced-context-management/spec.md.

## Recap

Successfully implemented the foundational components of advanced context management for Plato CLI/TUI, delivering semantic indexing capabilities and intelligent file selection algorithms. The implementation provides lightweight codebase analysis and relationship mapping that enables automatic file relevance scoring and smart context suggestions.

**Completed Features:**
- **Semantic Indexing Foundation**: Complete AST-based file analysis system with symbol extraction, cross-reference tracking, and dependency graph construction
- **Intelligent File Selection System**: Multi-factor relevance scoring algorithm with relationship-based file discovery and smart content sampling
- **FileAnalyzer Class**: Comprehensive code analysis with configurable indexing depth and scope
- **FileRelevanceScorer**: Advanced scoring system integrating user history, preferences, and code relationships
- **Index Storage & Serialization**: Efficient storage mechanism for semantic indexes with fast retrieval
- **Smart Sampling**: Context-preserving content extraction for large files
- **Comprehensive Test Coverage**: Full test suites for both semantic indexing and file selection components

## Context

Implement semantic indexing and intelligent file selection for Plato CLI/TUI to automatically suggest relevant files, provide smart content sampling, and enhance context visualization with 3x faster file discovery and 60% reduced context setup time.

This implementation establishes the core infrastructure needed for advanced context management, with the semantic indexing engine providing the foundation for understanding code relationships and the intelligent selection system enabling automated discovery of relevant files based on multiple factors including code dependencies, user patterns, and contextual relevance.
