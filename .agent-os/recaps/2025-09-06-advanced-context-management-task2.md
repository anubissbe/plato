# 2025-09-06 Recap: Advanced Context Management - Task 2

This recaps what was built for Task 2 of the spec documented at .agent-os/specs/2025-09-05-advanced-context-management/spec.md.

## Recap

Successfully implemented the intelligent file selection system for Plato's advanced context management. This provides smart relevance scoring and content sampling algorithms that automatically suggest the most relevant files based on multiple factors. The implementation includes:

- **FileRelevanceScorer class** - Multi-factor scoring algorithm for file relevance
- **ContentSampler class** - Smart content extraction within token budgets
- **User history tracking** - Learning from user patterns and preferences
- **Comprehensive test suite** - 18 passing tests covering all functionality
- **Integration with SemanticIndex** - Leverages Task 1's semantic indexing foundation

## Context

Implement intelligent file selection with relevance scoring and smart content sampling to automatically suggest the most relevant files and extract meaningful code snippets while respecting token budgets.

## Technical Implementation

### FileRelevanceScorer
- **Multi-factor scoring algorithm** with weighted factors:
  - Direct references (imports): 85 points
  - Symbol matching: 65 points  
  - Import chain distance: 40 points
  - Recent access: 30 points
  - User patterns: 35 points
  - Size penalty for large utility files
- **User history integration** for learning patterns
- **Configurable thresholds** for filtering results
- **Batch scoring** for multiple files

### ContentSampler
- **Multiple sampling strategies**:
  - Function-level extraction
  - Class structure with key methods
  - Type definitions and interfaces
  - Comment-aware documentation preservation
  - Context-sensitive keyword focus
- **Token budget management** with distribution across files
- **Smart truncation** to respect limits
- **Section merging** for overlapping relevant areas

## Key Features Delivered

1. **Relationship-based discovery** - Uses import graphs and symbol references
2. **User pattern learning** - Tracks and learns from file access patterns
3. **Configurable filtering** - Min score and max files thresholds
4. **Smart content sampling** - Multiple strategies for different file types
5. **Token budget distribution** - Intelligent allocation across multiple files
6. **Relevance-based ranking** - Files sorted by multi-factor scores

## Testing

All 18 tests passing:
- FileRelevanceScorer: 10 tests
- ContentSampler: 8 tests
- Coverage includes scoring, sampling, history, and budget management

## Next Steps

Task 3: Enhanced Context UI Integration - Integrate the intelligent file selection into Plato's TUI with visual indicators and interactive controls.
