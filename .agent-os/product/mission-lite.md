# Product Mission (Lite)

PlatoV3 is a pixel-perfect clone of Claude Code that authenticates with GitHub Copilot instead of Claude API.

Every visual element, command, and interaction is identical to Claude Code - users literally cannot tell the difference except for the login method. This provides the exact Claude Code experience at 70% lower cost using existing Copilot subscriptions.

Additionally, it's self-hostable, terminal-native, with persistent memory and an extensible platform for custom integrations.
