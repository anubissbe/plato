## Overview

Enable advanced mouse interactions in Plato's terminal UI to achieve pixel-perfect parity with Claude Code's mouse support. This enhancement transforms Plato from a keyboard-driven terminal application into a modern hybrid interface that supports both traditional terminal navigation and intuitive mouse-based interactions for improved user experience and productivity.

## User Stories

### Story 1: Interactive Click Actions
As a Plato user, I want to click on UI elements (buttons, slash command suggestions, menu items, conversation bubbles) to interact with them directly, so that I can navigate the interface more intuitively without relying solely on keyboard shortcuts. The workflow includes detecting mouse clicks on specific screen coordinates, mapping those coordinates to interactive elements, executing appropriate actions (e.g., inserting slash commands, selecting suggestions, triggering confirmations), and providing immediate visual feedback to confirm user interactions.

### Story 2: Precision Text Selection and Copy Operations  
As a Plato user, I want to select specific text portions with precise mouse drag operations and use system-standard copy mechanisms, so that I can efficiently extract conversation content, code snippets, or command outputs for external use. The workflow includes implementing character-level selection granularity, highlighting selected regions with proper terminal color codes, supporting both click-drag selection and triple-click line selection, and seamlessly integrating with system clipboard operations across platforms (Windows WSL, Linux, macOS).

### Story 3: Smooth Content Navigation
As a Plato user, I want to use mouse wheel scrolling to navigate through conversation history and long responses with precise control, so that I can quickly access previous context without losing my current position or disrupting the conversation flow. The workflow includes capturing scroll wheel events with configurable sensitivity, maintaining scroll position state across UI updates, providing smooth scrolling animation effects, and supporting both line-by-line and page-by-page navigation modes.

## Spec Scope

1. **Mouse Event Capture & Processing**: Implement comprehensive mouse event handling including click detection, drag operations, wheel scrolling, and coordinate-to-UI-element mapping with pixel-perfect accuracy for terminal-based components.

2. **Interactive UI Component System**: Enable click interactions for actionable elements including slash command autocomplete suggestions, confirmation dialogs, menu items, conversation message actions, and inline buttons with appropriate hover states and visual feedback.

3. **Advanced Text Selection Engine**: Build character-precise text selection supporting drag operations, word/line boundaries, multi-line selection spanning conversation turns, and visual selection highlighting that works correctly with terminal color codes and formatting.

4. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Ensure consistent mouse behavior across Windows (including WSL environments), Linux distributions, and macOS terminals with proper handling of different terminal emulators, mouse protocols, and system integration requirements.

## Out of Scope

- Complex mouse gestures (double-click actions, multi-touch, pinch-to-zoom)
- Custom mouse cursor graphics, animations, or hover tooltips
- Mouse-based window resizing or drag-and-drop file operations
- Advanced accessibility features like sticky mouse or click assistance
- Integration with external mouse hardware configurations or gaming mice features

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Pixel-Perfect Click Interactions**: All interactive UI elements (buttons, suggestions, menu items) respond accurately to mouse clicks with immediate visual feedback and proper action execution, matching Claude Code's interaction precision.

2. **Professional Text Selection Experience**: Character-level selection granularity with proper highlighting, support for both drag selection and keyboard-mouse combination selection, and seamless clipboard integration that works consistently across all supported platforms.

3. **Smooth Navigation Control**: Mouse wheel scrolling through conversation history with configurable sensitivity settings, proper scroll position persistence, smooth animation transitions, and intuitive navigation that feels natural for terminal and GUI users alike.
